👋 Hello World! I'm Pratik, a passionate software developer with a love for open-source and collaboration. I thrive on turning coffee into code ☕️💻 and building cool stuff that solves real-world problems.

🚀 Currently, I'm diving deep into C++ and javascript and exploring the realms of ReactJS. I believe in the power of community-driven development and enjoy contributing to open-source projects whenever I can.

🌱 I'm constantly learning and growing, embracing new challenges and expanding my skill set. Whether it's tinkering with C++ or exploring the latest tech trends, I'm always up for a coding adventure!

📫 Let's connect and collaborate! Feel free to reach out for simply chat about all things tech and beyond. You can also find me on linkedin @pratikgore / mail me pratikaj1010@gmail.com
